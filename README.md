# GreatReads

## The Project

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a way to track and organize their reading habits. This project focuses on the individual user and their personal reading experience. Users are able to create their own accounts, search for books and organize bookshelves of books. The search capability can search for thousands of books and users can add any book to their bookshelves. With each search result they can interact with books and view their information, including the author and a description of the book. A user can mark a book as read or unread, add personal notes about the book, and add or remove books to and from their shelves.

## Development Environment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
